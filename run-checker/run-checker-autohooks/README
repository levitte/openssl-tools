run-checker autohooks
=====================

The purpose of these run-checker hooks is to provide a foundation for
automatic rebuilds.  Setup is easy, just create an empty directory,
copy or symlink run-checker.sh and these hooks into it, clone an
openssl repo into the directory "openssl", then run run-checker.sh
repeatedly, for example as a cron job.

Example setup:

    $ git clone git://git.openssl.org/tools.git tools
    $ mkdir ~/run-checker
    $ cd ~/run-checker
    $ ln -s ../tools/run-checker/run-checker.sh \
            ../tools/run-checker/run-checker-autohooks/hook-{prepare,start,end,takedown} \
	    .
    $ git clone openssl-git@git.openssl.org:openssl.git openssl

A cronjob would look like this:

    2 */2 * * * cd $HOME/run-checker && bash ./run-checker.sh


hook-config
-----------

In addition to the hooks, one can also have a shell script called
`hook-config` with configuration variables.  Currently understood are:

- REPORT_FROM

  The email address used in the report From: header.  Defaults to
  'OpenSSL run-checker <openssl@openssl.org>'

- REPORT_RECIPIENT

  The email address reports will get sent to.  Defaults to
  '<openssl-commits@openssl.org>'

- SKIP_OPTS

  MUST be a bash array, containing run-checker options that should be
  skipped.  Defaults to the empty array.

- ONLY_OPTS

  MUST be a bash array.  If there are any elements, the elements are
  the only run-checker options that will be built.  Defaults to the
  empty array.
